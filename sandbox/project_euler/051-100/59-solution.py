# Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred
# standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For
# example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.
#
# A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII
# then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage
# with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text
# restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
#
# For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text
# message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the
# encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without
# both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.
#
# Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified
# method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the
# message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the
# message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password
# key for security, but short enough to be memorable.
#
# Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower
# case characters. Using 59-cipher.txt, a file containing the encrypted ASCII
# codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English
# words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the
# original text.

bigString = 'An extract taken from the introduction of one of Euler\'s most celebrated papers, "De summis serierum reciprocarum" [On the sums of series of reciprocals]: I have recently found, quite unexpectedly, an elegant expression for the entire sum of this series 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + etc., which depends on the quadrature of the circle, so that if the true sum of this series is obtained, from it at once the quadrature of the circle follows. Namely, I have found that the sum of this series is a sixth part of the square of the perimeter of the circle whose diameter is 1; or by putting the sum of this series equal to s, it has the ratio sqrt(6) multiplied by s to 1 of the perimeter to the diameter. I will soon show that the sum of this series to be approximately 1.644934066842264364; and from multiplying this number by six, and then taking the square root, the number 3.141592653589793238 is indeed produced, which expresses the perimeter of a circle whose diameter is 1. Following again the same steps by which I had arrived at this sum, I have discovered that the sum of the series 1 + 1/16 + 1/81 + 1/256 + 1/625 + etc. also depends on the quadrature of the circle. Namely, the sum of this multiplied by 90 gives the biquadrate (fourth power) of the circumference of the perimeter of a circle whose diameter is 1. And by similar reasoning I have likewise been able to determine the sums of the subsequent series in which the exponents are even numbers.'
